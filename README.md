# Javascipt Class notes and Exercises

## Purpose

Basically I wanted to have my class exercises and notes made available to me and my classmates online via Github.

## Repository content

Each day's notes and exercises can be found in a markdown file with the following naming convention:

```
[date: YYYYMMDD]_[Morning || Afternoon]_[Notes || Challenges || Exercise]
```

The correspong files that I did my work in can be found in the *js_files* directory with a similar name. Sometime it will be split into smaller files to reduce of code being run whilst testing it in the *index.html* file.

## To-Do List Challenge

Time to use your new-found event listener and web storage powers to build a to-do list app in the browser.

The aim is to make an app that meets the following criteria:

- [ ] You can add new tasks to the list
- [ ] Each task has a complete and remove button
- [ ] Complete - strikethrough the text and grey-out the task
- [ ] Remove - remove task from the list
- [ ] The data persists after closing the browser
- [ ] There is an input field where you can filter through the list of tasks
- [ ] The app looks production ready
- [ ] Make it pretty by adding your own CSS or using bootstrap

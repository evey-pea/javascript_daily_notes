# Afternoon Challenge 20200618

## Tic Tac Toe

This afternoon you'll try your hand at creating a tic-tac-toe game! Believe it or not, one of the most common challenge questions that gets asked of front end developers is to build this simple game. 

At this point you have all the skills you need to implement, style and properly score a tic-tac-toe game of your very own, so that will be the goal! 

- Using HTML, CSS & JS, build a tic tac toe game
- Allows two users to play against each other (they will play on the same browser window)
- the game should look like a tic-tac-toe board
- the game should know when one player has won!

The challenge description is intentionally vague, I want you to put on your problem solving caps and see what you can come up with!
